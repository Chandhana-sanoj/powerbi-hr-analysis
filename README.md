# HR Attendance & Work Mode Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **real-world HR attendance data** to understand employee presence, work-from-home behavior, and sick leave trends.

The objective was to transform raw operational HR data into a clear, interactive dashboard that enables HR teams and management to monitor workforce attendance patterns and make informed policy decisions.

## Business Problem
HR teams often struggle to answer questions such as:
- What is the overall employee presence rate?
- How frequently are employees working from home?
- How much sick leave is being taken?
- Are there attendance patterns by date or day of the week?

This project addresses these gaps by providing a single, consolidated Power BI dashboard.

- Measure overall employee **Presence %**
- Analyze **Work From Home (WFH %)**
- Track **Sick Leave (SL %)**
- Identify attendance trends over time
